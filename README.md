# Lightly Armed
A simple 2D HTML canvas game. A real fine work-in-progress.

## Demo
A relatively up to date demo is available here: [https://pat.sh/projects/lightly-armed/](https://pat.sh/projects/lightly-armed/).
 
Plus, here's a demo gif for those lazy to click a link.

## Future
A lot is currently planned for this game:
 - Firing your laser will make you go blind for a short duration
    - Currently not implemented, as that would make development rather difficult :)
 - 2+ player online (via WebRTC, minor hosted server for match-making)
    - Including private rooms
 - Power-ups
 - Level dangers (think fire vents, etc.)
 - Additional weapons
 - Add a little help section that details all powerups and basic rules.

This stuff will be added as I gain more interest. Adding multiplayer will probably come later, due to its intrinsic difficulty.
