draw format:

This is currently how the renderer expects objects to appear. Perhaps i'll just break it down into layers and add labels to each individual object. This will improve performance, and mean that all that is required is sorting of one array. This is rather feasible! I'll leave it for next commit to change this however.

Note that this is pretty much an OO rendering description, hopefully extendable to a library, because the world knows that we need another HTML5/JS game engine
This is for fun, go away

It actually could be better in this format, compared to single level - it means that updating clickables and animations are way easier


this.elements:
{
	"static": [		<= this field is for static visuals, that are not clickable/animated
		{
			"type": "text", 						<= how to handle drawing it, mandatory
			"zlevel": INTEGER, 						<= this field is mandatory
			"value": "this is the string printed",
			"pos": [XPOS, YPOS], 					<= this is the position that the text is rendered
			"size": NUMBER, 						<= size in pixels of the font
			"family": Arial 						<= what font the text is rendered in
		},
		{

		},
		..
		{

		}
	],
	"clickable": [ 		<= objects that can be clicked, requires functor to handle
	..
		"onclick": (obj, gs) => {function},
		"bounds": [xpos, ypos, width, height],			<=	where, if the mouse is clicked, that the onclick function is called
	],
	"animation": [		<= animated objects, must specify how to animate
	..
		{
		...
		"functor": (obj, dt) => {function} 			<= a function that changes the object. The obj passed into the function is the object itself
		}
	]
}


object format:
[..] denotes optional

{
	"type": "text",
	"zlevel": INTEGER,
	"font": "48px Arial",
	"value": "this is the string printed",
	"pos": [XPOS, YPOS], 					<= this is the position that the text is rendered
	"colour": "#bad455"						<= fuck yeah, its in Australian English
	["rotation": radians]			
}

{
	"type": "shape",
	"zlevel": INTEGER,
	"pos": [XPOS, YPOS],
	"width": NUMBER,
	"height": NUMBER,
	"shape": "rect", 
	"colour": "#fuck23"
}

{
	"type": "image",
	"zlevel": INTEGER,
	"pos": [XPOS, YPOS],
	"image": Image()						<= Image obj allows SVGs too!
}
